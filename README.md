# gitlab-ci-shellcheck

A utility (and pre-commit hook) for running shellcheck against shell scripts inside GitLab CI YAML files.

```bash
pip install gitlab-ci-shellcheck
```

Usage:
```bash
gitlab-ci-shellcheck --help
```

Note: this requires that `shellcheck` is installed separately and on PATH.
